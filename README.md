# Graffle2Svg Reloaded #

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jnavila/graffle2svg.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jnavila/graffle2svg)

This project is a fork of graffle2svg hosted at [google](http://code.google.com/p/graffle2svg/). *BUT* I changed the whole architecture of the program and added a lot of new features:

 * New shapes: Diamond, Cloud
 * Management of colors and sizes of arrows
 * Bounding box filtering
 * Speed up in processing the graffle file
 * Unicode support
 * Enhanced Text management

All these features were not back ported due to the change of architecture. 
 
In progress is an adaptation to use the script as an [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) import plugin. 
 
I am seriously considering renaming the project as it no longer matches the original code.
 
If you are interested in this project, please fill a ticket or submit a pull request.
